# Understanding Arrays: A Deep Dive

## Memory Structure:

In the realm of computing, think of your computer's memory as an expansive grid, akin to a massive array of slots. Each slot represents the smallest unit of memory and is uniquely identified by an address. These addresses form a contiguous sequence, laying the foundation for the concept of arrays.

| Address 0 | Address 1 | Address 2 | Address 3 | Address 4 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|   Data    |   Data    |   Data    |   Data    |   Data    |


```cpp
int myArray[5]; // Allocates a block of 5 integer slots in memory
```
